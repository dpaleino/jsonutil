jsonutil
========

jsonutil is a JSON manipulation utility.

It lets you extract various bits of data from a JSON object, with an
easy-to-understand "path" syntax.

The path syntax
---------------

Let's see the syntax of this "path":

 - if you want to get the full content of the JSON object, just search for
   "root", i.e. /.
 - if the (sub-)object is a dict, you can use the key in the path, let's say
   /key/.
 - if the (sub-)object is a list, you can access the wanted element by its
   list index, starting from 0. So, for the first element of the root list:
   /0/.

The above syntax works recursively. So, if you have a dictionary, with a
"test" key, whose value is a list of objects, you can get the third element
of this list with /test/2/.

Available commands
------------------

The list of available commands is accessible from the command's --help option.
The list there is the only authoritative one, the one in here is just for
reference, and may be out-of-date.

This is the list of available commands, with their explanation:

  -g , --get
    Get the value of the element at the given path. This is the default action
    if no command is given.

  -s VALUE , --set=VALUE
    Set the value of the element at the given path to VALUE. The json will not
    be written in-place, you should use something like sponge(1). jsonutil will
    not overwrite data of a different type, unless you use --force.

  -l , --length
    Get the length of the element at the given path. This applies to
    dictionaries, lists and strings.

  -t , --type
    Return the type of the element pointed by the given path.

  -k , --keys
    Lists the keys of the element pointed by the given path, if it's a
    dictionary.

Other options
-------------

There are other options available, which should be used in combination with one
of the above commands:

  -f , --force
    Only makes sense when used with --set: force the setting of a value, even
    if it overwrites a different type of element.

  -p , --pretty
    Pretty print an indented JSON. This should only be used to ease reading by
    a human.
